# Elevator Simulator
The Elevator Simulator is a console application written in Java that simulates the movement of elevators with the goal of efficiently moving people. It allows users to request an elevator from a specific floor and tracks the status of the elevators, including their current floor, direction, and the number of people they are carrying. The simulator also incorporates a weight limit, expressed as the number of people an elevator can accommodate.
# Features
•	Request an elevator: Users can request an elevator by specifying the floor they are currently on and the number of people to be transported. The simulator will allocate   the nearest available elevator that can accommodate the requested number of people.
•	Update elevator status: Users can check the status of all elevators managed by the simulator, including the current floor, direction of movement, and the number of people   inside.
•	Weight limit: Each elevator has a weight limit expressed as the maximum number of people it can carry. The simulator checks the weight limit before allocating an elevator   to ensure it can accommodate the requested number of people. If an elevator is already at its weight limit, it will not accept additional passengers.
