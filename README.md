The Elevator Simulator is a console application written in Java that simulates the movement of elevators with the goal of efficiently moving people. It allows users to request an elevator from a specific floor and tracks the status of the elevators, including their current floor, direction, and the number of people they are carrying. The simulator also incorporates a weight limit, expressed as the number of people an elevator can accommodate.
